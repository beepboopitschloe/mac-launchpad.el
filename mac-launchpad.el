;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides an interface for opening OS X apps from inside emacs,
;; with autocompletion. The intention is to provide similar functionality to the
;; native "launchpad" application.
;;
;; TODO:
;; - mac-launchpad doesn't find .apps inside folders, such as Adobe Photoshop
;; - configure applications directory
;; - allow multiple applications directories
;; - add option to show app icons in minibuffer?

           (string= (substring s (- 0 elength)) ending)))
        (t nil)))
